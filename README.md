Setup / Development
----

Skip relevant steps when required.

#### 1. Install required dependencies

Do `npm install`, and `npm install grunt grunt-cli --save-dev` if required.

Install node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) as it should also include with npm.

#### 2. Make modifications in `source/` folder.

In the contents of the `source/` folder:

- `configs.jsx`: Defines the App Keys based on the different environment. Modify `local` only. You can [sign up for your own App key here](https://console.temasys.io).

- `index.html`: Defines the HTML file for getaroom app. This contains the Google Analytics settings in which you can modify for your custom getaroom app.

- `jsx/`: The React JSX files for the Javascript end.

   - `constants.jsx`: Defines the getaroom constants used across the getaroom app.

   - `loader.jsx`: Defines the dependencies and libraries versions.

   - `main.jsx`: Handles the Temasys Web SDK connection.

   - `utils.jsx`: Handles the utilities functionalities used across the getaroom app.

   - `components/controls.jsx`: Handles the getaroom app controls.

   - `components/userareas.jsx`: Handles the user video element.

- `js/`: The generated output Javascript files from the React JSX files. Do not modify changes on here.

   - `libs/`: Stores the custom dependencies Javascript files if needed.

- `img/`: Stores the `jsx/components/controls.jsx` icons.

- `assets/`: Stores the getaroom logo.

- `styles/`: The Stylus files for the CSS end. Dont not modify the `.css` files in there as they are auto-generated.

   - `mixins/`: The mixin files.

   - `app.styl`: The getaroom app styling.

   - `fonts.styl`: The getaroom font styling if needed.

- `ca.crt`: The CA cert file for localhost webserver `https:`. This is self-signed. Replace for your own app when required.

- `server.crt`: The server cert file for localhost webserver `https:`. This is self-signed. Replace for your own app when required.

- `server.key`: The certificate private key for localhost webserver `https:`. This is self-signed. Replace for your own app when required.


#### 3. Start testing modifications

Run `grunt dev` to compile the React JSX (js) and Stylus (css) files.

This opens `https://localhost:8085` in your browser as it runs localhost webserver on your device.

#### 4. Make it production ready

Once ready for production, run `grunt stage` to create a `staging/` folder which contains the compiled and minified version of the application.

Then run `grunt publish` to move the `staging/` contents to `publish/` folder. Use files from the `publish/` folder to host on your own webserver.
